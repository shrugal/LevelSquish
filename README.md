# LevelSquish

This addon aims to simulate the discussed "level squish" by halving all unit levels in the game. This means e.g. all lvl 120 players and mobs will be shown as lvl 60, lvl 60 units as lvl 30 and so on.

Get it from [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/levelsquish) or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25062-LevelSquish.html)!

DISCLAIMER:

- We have to override and replace quite a few build-in functions and constants, so there might be problems with other addons or the Blizzard UI itself. I personally haven't experienced any problems yet, but your mileage may vary!
- Some level-based unlocks in the UI might happen one level too early or too late, because of the unavoidable rounding error when halving e.g. a level 25 unlock threshold or player level.
